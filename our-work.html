Held at a beautifully arranged venue, the event was filled with a spectrum of emotions and unforgettable moments. More than just a review of achievements, it also marked the dawn of a new journey for the next generation of the QuantaQuest Foundation.<br><br>The ceremony was honored by the presence of:<br>Mr. Pham Ngoc – Co-founder of QuantaQuest<br>Mr. Tran Tung – Co-founder of QuantaQuest<br><br>And esteemed alumni, along with all the students from the QuantaQuest Community Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>The ceremony opened with a captivating performance by the G18 cohort, a blend of drama and dance titled "Walking Amidst Radiant Skies," leaving a profound impression on everyone present. Warm applause and heartfelt congratulations filled the hall, officially welcoming 28 new G18 students into the large QuantaQuest family. This marked the beginning of a fresh chapter, where these students will collectively navigate challenges, learn, grow, and contribute to illuminating the core values of the QuantaQuest community.<br><br>In the next segment of the program, everyone came together to celebrate the graduation of 10 students. We listened intently to their sincere thoughts and feelings about their university journeys and their cherished time with the QuantaQuest Foundation. The joyous laughter intertwined with emotional tears, as each student's story painted a vibrant picture of relentless effort, unwavering belief, and an aspiring drive to thrive in life.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the invaluable insights shared by the Foundation's Executive Board, and the profound affection conveyed in the narratives of our pioneering alumni, will serve as powerful motivation and essential guidance. These will be the enduring companions for the G18 generation in particular, and for all QuantaQuest students in general, as they continue to stride forward, build their dreams, and craft wonderful futures.`

And Doan Trong – a G18 generation student of QuantaQuest, currently studying at Vietnam-Korea University of Information and Communication Technology.<br><br>During the moments spent with the students' families, the Executive Board heard about Truong's and Trong's tireless efforts to overcome life's and academic challenges. These stories were not only testaments to their strong resilience but also great sources of inspiration, empowering the QuantaQuest Foundation to continue its mission of supporting generations of Vietnamese students.<br><br>The visit left many warm and meaningful emotions in the hearts of the Executive Board members. It also affirmed that, with the Foundation's companionship and the students' determination, the flames of hope will always be lit, regardless of the circumstances.<br><br>The "Igniting Dreams" journey of QuantaQuest continues. Beautiful stories of resilience and aspiration from our students will continue to be recognized and shared by the Foundation in the coming time. Stay tuned!`

                content: 'The deeply meaningful and humane journey of the QuantaQuest Foundation has entered a significant phase, marking a path of perseverance, dedication, and unwavering effort to connect with and provide educational opportunities for thousands of underprivileged students across the nation. The growth and maturity of these student generations stand as the clearest testament to the enduring values QuantaQuest has built and continues to uphold, striving for a bright future where every dream can be within reach.<br><br>Reflecting on the Foundation\'s inception, Mr. Pham Ngoc, Co-founder of QuantaQuest, recalls: "Our initial idea, born from witnessing the struggles of talented students post-pandemic, was to create a charitable foundation that could empower bright, underprivileged students to reach university lecture halls. After dedicated efforts from our founding team and passionate individuals, the QuantaQuest initiative began in 2022. Our core principle was to promote learning and talent, offer full scholarships, and commit to accompanying students throughout their academic journey. This dream has now culminated in the official establishment of the QuantaQuest Foundation." Today, QuantaQuest operates with the unwavering support and generous contributions of its dedicated staff, along with numerous organizations, businesses, and individuals both domestically and internationally.<br><br>Over its dedicated years of operation, QuantaQuest has achieved commendable results, building a strong positive influence within the community and affirming its role among philanthropic organizations in Vietnam through its professionalism, precision, and fairness. Thousands of scholarships have been awarded to students in particularly difficult circumstances, totaling significant support. Beyond financial aid, numerous supportive activities have been organized to help students cultivate soft skills, enhance their physical and mental well-being, unleash their individual talents, and assist them in finding internship opportunities.<br><br>Looking back at this journey, Mr. Tran Song Tung, Co-founder and a driving force behind QuantaQuest, shares: "From those initial ideas and first steps to the scale of operation we envision today, it\'s the result of tireless efforts from various generations of our executive team and the students themselves. But our greatest success and pride lies in the story of how our alumni have thrived in their careers and lives."<br><br>QuantaQuest focuses on university students because we deeply understand the overwhelming burden of tuition costs that many students and their families simply cannot bear. Annually, countless bright young individuals from impoverished rural areas are forced to put their dreams of becoming teachers, doctors, or engineers on hold because their families lack the income to cover expenses. Therefore, QuantaQuest\'s timely support ignites faith in life, creating opportunities, motivation, and strong determination for students on their paths to education and career establishment. Believing in our mission and operating principles, and understanding the positive values QuantaQuest fosters, many domestic and international organizations and corporations have connected with us, wishing to join hands to fulfill more dreams and light up even more hopes for the future generation of the nation.<br><br>Regarding the Foundation\'s future direction, Mr. Pham Ngoc expresses the desire for QuantaQuest\'s model to become even more socialized, with broader participation from diverse organizations, businesses, and individuals. In today\'s technological era, this is entirely feasible. "From its very inception, QuantaQuest set a clear and correct development direction by consistently focusing its charitable efforts on education, specifically higher education. The Foundation\'s operations are conducted with transparency. In terms of operational efficiency, QuantaQuest has optimized the effectiveness of donated funds, building trust with our sponsors. These are robust foundations for the Foundation\'s future growth," Mr. Ngoc further emphasized.<br><br>Based on the effectiveness achieved over the past period, QuantaQuest\'s key objective for the future is to continue seeking out and awarding scholarships – which are also opportunities to help disadvantaged students realize their dreams of attending university and empower them on their career paths.'

Guests for these counseling sessions included alumni and volunteers with many years of professional experience, who enthusiastically shared their knowledge and provided career guidance to the students.<br><br>Pharmacy students received advice from Ms. Vu Thi Thao, a G2 alumna from Hanoi University of Pharmacy. She currently works at Novo Nordisk Pharmaceutical Company and, notably, owns her private pharmacy "Thao Dat." Joining the program was Mr. Nguyen Huy Trinh – Factory Director of Novo Nordisk Pharmaceutical. Both guests have years of professional experience and have held various positions in the pharmaceutical field. They provided invaluable advice to pharmacy students, helping them accumulate more knowledge, experience, and guiding them on their future career development paths.<br><br>Subsequently, the counseling session for Medical students was attended by Dr. Nguyen Ba Hung – Head of Medical Department, Hanoi Branch, Insmart Company, and Dr. Nguyen Minh Nghia – Lecturer at Hanoi Medical University. These are leading doctors (residents) in the fields of internal medicine and surgery. The counseling session provided immense value to the students, from practical experience and future career orientation to effective study and internship tips.<br><br>The doctors and pharmacists did not hesitate to share their career journeys, from challenges to successes, from memorable experiences to invaluable lessons learned along their professional paths. These practical stories and experiences not only served as motivation but also as great inspiration for the students, helping them to gain a clearer understanding of the Medical and Pharmaceutical industries. Many student questions during the sharing sessions reflected not only curiosity and interest but also a strong desire to accumulate knowledge and gain deeper, clearer insights into the professions they are pursuing.<br><br>The two counseling sessions were successfully concluded, providing valuable knowledge to all participants. This was a precious opportunity for students to learn and connect. The Foundation\'s Executive Board hopes that such important and meaningful counseling sessions will be maintained and continued; and especially encourages QuantaQuest alumni to actively participate and support, helping the next generation gain proper direction on their own journeys of striving; because their practical experiences are truly invaluable lessons for those who follow.'

As the founder and developer of the center, which has nurtured math self-study skills for thousands of students, few know that Ms. Lien herself once faced extremely difficult circumstances. Her family relied on farming, with their main income from five rice fields. Her father suffered from joint pain and could not do heavy labor, leaving the financial burden on her mother. Ms. Lien herself battled heart disease and joint inflammation, significantly impacting her health and studies. With an elder sister attending university and a younger sibling in high school, the financial strain on her family was immense.<br><br>Ms. Lien learned about the QuantaQuest Foundation from her high school homeroom teacher. Recognizing her student\'s difficult situation, the teacher sought out scholarship programs and introduced her to QuantaQuest. Thanks to her teacher\'s encouragement, Ms. Lien applied and received invaluable support from the Foundation. From that moment, she tirelessly strived to become the successful and socially contributing individual she is today.<br><br>Cherished Memories and Enduring Support<br><br>Despite studying far from the main community, Ms. Lien always felt the Foundation\'s care. A particularly memorable moment was her first in-person meeting with Foundation members when she was undergoing treatment at Bach Mai Hospital for a chronic somatic disorder. "At that moment, I was so happy and touched," Ms. Lien shared emotionally. "The care and encouragement from the QuantaQuest family gave me the strength to overcome that difficult period of treatment."<br><br>She also vividly recalls the Foundation\'s 8th anniversary. The organizers created a false scenario that the Foundation would "cease operations," causing everyone to be sad and worried to tears. When the "play" was revealed, everyone burst into tears of joy. Ms. Lien has consistently participated in the Foundation\'s significant events, from its 10th anniversary in Da Nang to its 15th anniversary in Vung Tau.<br><br>A Journey of Spreading Love, Igniting Dreams<br><br>Beyond being a recipient, Ms. Lien has always aspired to give back the good values she received. Over 10 years, she has achieved remarkable success. The Love Math Center, which she and her husband founded, now boasts three branches with over 2,000 students and 100 staff, teachers, and teaching assistants. Additionally, she actively organizes charitable programs like "Love Math and Friends" in western Nghe An, sponsoring Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations for children with disabilities, and supporting other disadvantaged individuals.<br><br>Speaking about QuantaQuest, she emphasizes that the Foundation was not just financial support but also a spiritual pillar throughout her academic and career journey. She has actively participated in various activities, including verifying new students\' backgrounds, organizing charity programs, promoting the Foundation, and interviewing scholarship applicants. Every action stems from deep gratitude for the Foundation – the place that gave her the opportunity to change her life.<br><br>As an alumna, Ms. Lien wants to convey an important message to the younger generation: do not shy away from any difficulties, and never allow yourselves to be lazy. "To sustain my dreams and career as I do today, my husband and I went through incredibly challenging times, from selling online noodles in the morning, teaching in the afternoon, and even taking on odd jobs like cleaning or parking attendant," she shared. "When starting out, everyone faces difficulties, but if you persevere, work diligently, and aren\'t afraid of challenges, you will eventually reap worthy rewards."<br><br>"Most importantly, I hope that the younger generation of students will always remember gratitude and the spirit of readiness to give back. We are where we are today, partly thanks to the Foundation\'s help. Therefore, once you have grown and are able, please consider contributing to continue spreading this value," Ms. Lien emphasized. She believes that if every QuantaQuest alumna contributes just 100,000 VND/month (1.2 million VND/year), that amount is small compared to a single scholarship. But if everyone works together, that sum will be enough to help many more students. This is also a way for everyone to express their gratitude to the Foundation.<br><br>Currently, the Foundation has Alumni Liaison Boards in 5 cities/provinces: Hanoi, Hue, Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Can Tho. These serve as platforms for alumni to connect, support each other in work and life, and collaborate on the Foundation\'s activities. Ms. Lien hopes that in the future, each province will have an alumni group to further support and partner with the Foundation.'
